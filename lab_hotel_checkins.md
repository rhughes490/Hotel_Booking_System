# Full-stack Lab: Hotel Bookings

**Duration: All Day**

## Learning Objectives

- Be able to create a full-stack app
- Practice building a server with a MongoDB for persistence
- Understand the relationship between a client, server and database

## Brief

Build a system to allow a hotel to manage bookings. There should be a form to allow the hotel to add the following information for each booking:

- Guest Name
- Guest Email Address
- Checked in status

Bookings should be stored in a MongoDB via an JSON API in Express.

## MVP

- Hotel managers should be able to view a list of all bookings
- Hotel managers should be able to add a new booking, which should update the page without the page being refreshed
- Hotel managers should be able to delete bookings

## Extension

- Allow the hotel manager to update the "checked in" status of the booking
- Anything else you'd like to add that you think would be useful for your user - the hotel manager

## Considerations

Test your code often. Try not to write very much code before you run it again. We value working software, even if it is not feature-complete and want to isolate problems so we can fix them more quickly. You can use Insomnia REST Client to test the Express API.

## Planning

Wireframe the client application before you build anything; what components will you need? What state (data) will each component hold? What will the hierarchy of components be?
